# Coin-toss-project
The Coin Toss Game is a simple C program that simulates flipping a coin. The player chooses either Heads or Tails, and the computer randomly generates the result to determine whether the player wins or loses. . Features  Allows user to select Heads or Tails.  Generates random outcomes using the rand() function.  
🪙 Coin Toss Project

🔹 Objective

To simulate a real-life coin toss using computer programming.

To understand the concept of randomness and probability through code.

To learn how to use conditional statements and random functions in programming.



---

🔹 Technology Used

Programming Language: (Write yours, e.g., Python / C / Java / JavaScript)

Concepts Used: Random number generation, conditional statements (if-else), user input/output

Tools/IDE: (e.g., VS Code, Turbo C, or any you used)



---

🔹 Working Process

1. The program starts and waits for the user to initiate the coin toss.


2. The system generates a random number (0 or 1).


3. If the number is 0 → output is Heads.


4. If the number is 1 → output is Tails.


5. The result is displayed to the user.


6. The process can be repeated multiple times for multiple tosses.




---

🔹 Features

Simple and interactive interface.

Random and fair output for each toss.

Can be extended to show win counts or probability results.



---

🔹 Applications

Learning basic programming logic.

Understanding randomness and probability concepts.

Useful for beginners in coding and logic building.
3. Run the program:

Python: python coin_toss.py

C: Compile and run using any C compiler.

Java: javac CoinToss.java then java CoinToss
